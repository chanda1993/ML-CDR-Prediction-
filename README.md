## Using Predictive Analytics Model in images to predict the cognitive status of patients

## Objective
- Fundamentals of machine learning
- Evaluating the algorithm to run the test
- Records and thought process

## Approach

## Notes on CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)
CDR-0: no cognitive impairment

CDR-0.5: questionable or very mild dementia

CDR-1: mild

CDR-2: moderate

CDR-3: severe

## Notes on the sum of the boxes score
In some clinical trials the CDR is used as a more quantitative “sum-of-the-boxes” numerical rating. This sums up the scores of the six individual domains and expresses it on a range from 0 to 18 and is more sensitive than the 4-point CDR staging from 0.5, to 1, 2, and 3
