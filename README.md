# Subject : Patients' Cognitive Status Prediction
Classification of patients' images using Support Vector Machines

## Using Predictive Analytics Model in images to predict the cognitive status of patients

## Objective
- Fundamentals of machine learning
- Evaluating the algorithm to run the test
- Records and thought process

## Approach
Support Vector Machine Algorithm

## Notes on CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)
The CDR is based on a scale of 0â€“3: no dementia (CDR = 0), questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5), MCI (CDR = 1), moderate cognitive impairment (CDR = 2), and severe cognitive impairment (CDR = 3). Two sets of questions are asked, one for the informant and another for the subject. Source https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-dementia-rating
